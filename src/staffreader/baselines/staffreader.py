"""Our own reader: the layout stage finds the staves, the staff reader
reads each one, and the staves are joined into parts.

The model is the checkpoint STAFFREADER_MODEL names, or the best one of
the newest training run. Its name and step are part of NAME, so the
suite caches each model's readings apart from every other's.

A page's staves are read top to bottom. The layout groups each system's
staves into parts (a braced grand staff is one part on two staves), and
every system of a page is taken to hold the same parts in the same
order, so the k-th group of each system is the k-th part; each staff's
bars follow on, system after system."""
